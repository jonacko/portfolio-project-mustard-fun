## 1. Summary

This project was undertaken as a submission for a Birmingham City Bootcamp assignment, with a brief to create a web page portfolio suitable for prospective employers' viewing. The user story and acceptance criteria are as follows:

## 2. Key features

- Hero image with buttons that respond to 'hover' and link to relevant parts on webpage
- 4 x project buttons that respond to 'hover' and open link in new tab
- Use of variables to maintain styling consistency with font & colour
- Optimised for most smartphones and small tablets

## 2a. Key optimization amendments (for smartphone/small tablet eg. iPad air/iPad mini)

- Scroll left/right disabled
- Hero image adjusted to respond to width of screen
- Hero buttons hidden & replaced with smaller left nav bar
- About/contact section adjusted to fit width of screen
- Flex direction adjusted so all sections sit in columns
- Opacity changed to 100% on buttons to support visually (& not as much need for reactive buttons on smartphone/tablet)
- Project button widths adjusted to fit screen; scaling adjusted to work aesthetically yet keep the first application larger in size than others
- Use of viewport width to amend elements proportionally


## 3. Issues encountered/further amendments
- Linking images for buttons from asset folder did not work (link in CSS worked but appeared blank in HTML) - links to image URL instead but unfortunately these show the watermarks
- Aligning buttons over the hero image - difficulty getting them to sit with exact spacing when optimized for tablet
- Optimization for large tablet - commented out - ran out of time to complete this; amendments appeared to affect small tablet optimization hence commenting this out
- Code consolidation - I consolodated a lot of the CSS code along the way but there it could still be made more elegant given more time.
